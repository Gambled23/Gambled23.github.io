            <p>I'm César González, a 19 years old student at Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenierías
                (CUCEI UDG), born in México, living in Guadalajara, Jalisco.</p>
            <p>Since I was a child I was curious about computers, and my passion just grew when I got my first computer
                and started to explore its insides and outsides. </p>
            <p>I started learning programming without knowing. When I was 14 years old using tasker, without knowing
                that I was learning the basics of problem solving, just trying to automate my life.</p>
            <p>Shortly after that, I learned that you could do the same thing I was doing with tasker in my phone,
                writing code in a computer, so I started to watch online courses about coding and started to learn java.
            </p>
            <p>My journey with coding was not an easy one, while I knew the basics of structured programming and had
                good problem solving skills, learning the syntax of an advanced programming language was difficult, so I
                dropped learning to code for a while and started to focus more on another things I liked, like editing
                videos.</p>
            <p>It was until 2021 when I decided to study computer science that I tried coding again, and with the right
                focus I got hold of the basics of C and C++, which helped me to study for myself the things I really
                liked, like a discord bot made with python, little games, animations played in the console, even this
                web page!</p>
            <p>When I started taking classes like red administration, and server configuration, I discovered another
                passion of mine, I was very surprised to see all you can do to connect devices in a network.</p>
            <p>For now, since I have some free time, I decided to learn css, make and self host this web page on a
                raspberry pi, and I think it turned really good!</p>
            <p>Now (2023) I'm starting my 5th semester, and I'm really happy with my decision, I'm learning a lot of
                things that I like, and I'm really excited to see what the future holds for me.</p>
